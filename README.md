Brain Tumor Classification:
The objective and motivation of this study is to develop a roboust machine learning model for brain tumor classification using MRI images.
Leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically MLP we aim to accurately classify brain images into tumor and non-tumor categories.
The project aimss to address the challenge of limited data availability  in medical imaging datasets by Transfer learning which enables models to learn from a limited number of examples.
Data Description := Number of samples : The dataset contains 250 MRI images of brain tumor and normal brain tissues.
Classes: The datasset iss labelled as binary classification problem with 2 classes,
Tumor (YES): 150 images
Non Tumor(NO): 100 images
Image size : (180,218) (width*height)
Image mode : RGB
